# MuControl-odrive
MuControl-odrive is a fork of [MuControl](https://github.com/czimm79/MuControl) which actuates [ODrive](https://odriverobotics.com/) brushless motors. These motors are integrated in a custom 3D-printed permanent magnet actuator for the generation of magnetic fields for microbot actuation.
